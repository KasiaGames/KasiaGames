                                <p>
                                    We choose to make a Unity game because we wanted to learn how to make games using C# and unity.
                                </p>
                                <h1>
                                    What kind of game is it and how did we get the idea?
                                </h1>
                                <p>
                                   We chose to make an rpg and we chose for the name Soulbreaker. We didnt finish most of the ideas. The story of the game takes place on an island. In the story the evil guy stole the soles of the people and put them in crystals to use it to create his own world and become a god of that world. The goal of the game is to stop him by destroying the crystals and freeing the souls. But the crystals are protected by enemies that the player needs to defeat. When a player defeats a enemie the player gets coins which can be used to buy weapons. We also had the idea of adding 3 classes. Those classes are magic, ranged and melee. We where planning on giving the island differnt zones for example a dessert, a jungle, a cave and a vulkano.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We learned how to program using C# and we learned how to use C# to make a game. We used different websites and videos to learn it.
                                </p>
                                <h1>
                                    What problems did we encounter while making the game?
                                </h1>
                                <p>
                                    We didnt finish it in time because the project we chose was to large. We also had problems with the cloud storage and we couldnt program at school because we werent allowed to download programs.
                                    We also encountered multiple problems while programing. The pathfinding was the biggest obstacle we encountered. We understood how it worked but didnt know how to make code for it. After some time we dicided to use the code of someone else. The code decided to use was made by pickles976.
